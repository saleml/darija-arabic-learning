## Data Collection Process

### Step 1: Source Discovery
1. Search academic databases for Darija-Arabic comparative studies
2. Identify online Moroccan Arabic dictionaries
3. Find Lebanese/Syrian/Gulf Arabic resources
4. Locate dialect comparison resources
5. Document source URL, author, date, reliability tier

### Step 2: Phrase Extraction
1. Start with high-frequency everyday phrases
2. Prioritize phrases with cultural significance
3. Include formal/informal variations
4. Note regional differences within Darija itself
5. Record source reference for each phrase

### Step 3: Translation Gathering
For each Darija phrase:
1. Find Lebanese Arabic equivalent
2. Find Syrian Arabic equivalent  
3. Find Gulf (Emirati/Saudi) equivalents
4. Find Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) form
5. Note pronunciation differences
6. Record formality level

### Step 4: Validation Protocol
1. **Primary Validation**: Cross-reference with 2+ Tier 1/2 sources
2. **Context Check**: Verify usage scenarios match
3. **Cultural Review**: Ensure appropriateness across regions
4. **Variation Note**: Document acceptable alternatives
5. **Red Flag**: Mark phrases needing expert review

### Step 5: Context Enhancement
1. Add usage examples (when/where to use)
2. Include cultural notes (what to avoid)
3. Note gender variations if applicable
4. Add formality indicators
5. Include common responses/follow-ups

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Accuracy Checks
- **Literal Translation**: Verify word-for-word meaning

- **Regional Sensitivity**: Flag potentially offensive variations

### Completeness Checks
- Each phrase has all 5 dialect translations
- Cultural context provided where needed
- Difficulty level assigned
- Category properly tagged
- Pronunciation guide included

### Consistency Checks
- Transliteration system consistent
- Formatting uniform across entries
- Categories non-overlapping
- Difficulty progression logical
