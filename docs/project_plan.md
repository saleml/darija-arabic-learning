## Resource Allocation

### Research Sources Priority
1. **Primary Sources**
   - Moroccan Arabic dictionaries (Harrell's, Peace Corps)
   - Lebanese Arabic resources (Lingualism, Mango)
   - Gulf Arabic collections (ArabicPod101, Innovative Language)
   - Academic papers on dialectal differences

2. **Secondary Sources**
   - Language exchange forums (Reddit r/learn_arabic, Discord)
   - Native speaker content (YouTube channels, social media)
   - Travel phrase books and guides
   - Online translation tools for verification

3. **Validation Sources**
   - Multiple dictionary cross-references
   - Native speaker forums for usage confirmation
   - Cultural guides for context validation

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Data Collection Bottlenecks**
   - Risk: Limited access to quality sources
   - Mitigation: Multiple backup sources identified

2. **Translation Accuracy**
   - Risk: Incorrect or outdated translations
   - Mitigation: Cross-reference minimum 3 sources per phrase

3. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Feature expansion beyond timeline
   - Mitigation: Strict MVP focus with future roadmap

4. **Technical Challenges**
   - Risk: Complex audio implementation
   - Mitigation: Start with text-based MVP, audio as enhancement

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Goals
- Minimum 500 thoroughly researched phrases
- 5+ regional variations per phrase
- 95% translation accuracy (validated)
- Sub-200ms search response time
- Mobile responsive at 3 breakpoints

### Qualitative Goals
- Intuitive user interface
- Clear learning progression
- Culturally sensitive content
- Practical, real-world phrases
- Engaging learning experience

## Checkpoint System

### Data Collection Checkpoints
- Every 50 phrases: Save and backup data
- Every 100 phrases: Validate and review quality
- Every category completion: Cross-reference accuracy

### Development Checkpoints
- Component completion: Unit testing
- Feature completion: Integration testing
- Daily: Progress log update
- Phase completion: Stakeholder review

## Deliverables Checklist

1. **Core Deliverables**
   - [ ] React web application (production-ready)
   - [ ] JSON database (500+ phrases)
   - [ ] User documentation
   - [ ] Technical documentation
   - [ ] Deployment guide

2. **Supporting Materials**
   - [ ] Research methodology document
   - [ ] Database expansion guide
   - [ ] Future roadmap document
   - [ ] Testing results report

## Resumption Protocol

If work is interrupted:
1. Check `progress_log.md` for last completed task
2. Review `database/checkpoint_*.json` for latest data
3. Check git commits for code state
4. Resume from next uncompleted task in this plan
5. Update progress log with resumption note

## Notes
- Prioritize quality over quantity for phrase collection
- Focus on practical, everyday usage
- Maintain cultural sensitivity throughout
- Document all decisions for future reference
- Keep user experience at center of all decisions
