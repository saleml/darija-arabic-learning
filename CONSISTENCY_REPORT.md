# Database & Code Consistency Report

## Executive Summary
After a comprehensive audit of the codebase and database schema, all critical inconsistencies have been identified and fixed.

## Database Tables Overview

### Active Tables (Used in Code)
1. **phrases** (552 records)
   - Stores all phrases and sentences
   - Properly synced with JSON files
   - All fields match code expectations

2. **phrase_progress** 
   - Tracks user progress per phrase
   - ✅ FIXED: Field names now match (correct_count, incorrect_count, is_mastered)
   - Foreign key to phrases table works correctly

3. **quiz_attempts**
   - Stores quiz history
   - All fields match code usage
   - Working correctly

4. **user_progress**
   - Stores aggregate user progress
   - Used for backward compatibility
   - May be redundant with phrase_progress

5. **user_stats**
   - Aggregate statistics
   - Partially used in analytics

### Potentially Unused Tables
- **user_profiles**: Referenced in analytics but may not be actively used
- **study_sessions**: Referenced but implementation incomplete

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ Schema Mismatch in phrase_progress
**Problem**: Code expected `times_correct/times_seen` but DB had `correct_count/incorrect_count`
**Solution**: Updated supabaseProgress.ts to use correct field names
**Status**: FIXED and deployed

### 2. ✅ Missing Sentences in Database
**Problem**: Sentences sent_301-400 were missing from phrases table
**Solution**: Inserted 100 missing sentences via script
**Status**: FIXED - Database now has all 552 phrases

### 3. ✅ Mixed Translation Types
**Problem**: JSON had mixed string/object translations
**Solution**: Updated DashboardPage.tsx to handle both types
**Status**: FIXED and deployed

### 4. ✅ Interface Mismatch in lib/supabase.ts
**Problem**: PhraseProgress interface didn't match database schema
**Solution**: Updated interface to match actual database fields
**Status**: FIXED

## Current State

### ✅ Working Correctly
- Quiz system saves progress properly
- Phrases are marked as mastered correctly
- Progress counters increment properly
- All 552 phrases are in the database
- Foreign key constraints work
- Data flows correctly from JSON → Database → UI

### ⚠️ Potential Improvements
1. **Remove redundant tables**: user_progress might be redundant with phrase_progress
2. **Complete study_sessions**: Either implement or remove
3. **Add indexes**: Consider adding indexes for performance
4. **Add migrations**: Create migration scripts for future schema changes

## Data Flow Verification

### JSON → Database
- ✅ All phrases from JSON files are in database
- ✅ Translation formats handled correctly (both string and object)
- ✅ IDs are unique and consistent

### Database → Application
- ✅ Supabase operations use correct field names
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces match database schema
- ✅ Progress tracking works correctly

### Application → Database
- ✅ Quiz results save correctly
- ✅ Manual mastery marking works
- ✅ Progress updates persist

## Recommendations

1. **Clean up unused tables**: Remove or implement user_profiles and study_sessions
2. **Add database migrations**: Version control for schema changes
3. **Consider consolidation**: Merge user_progress and user_stats if redundant
4. **Add monitoring**: Track failed database operations
5. **Document schema**: Keep schema documentation up to date

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Quiz completion increments counter correctly
- [x] "Mark as mastered" saves to database
- [x] Progress persists between sessions
- [x] All phrases load correctly
- [x] No console errors in production
- [x] Foreign key constraints don't block operations

## Conclusion

All critical inconsistencies have been resolved. The application now has:
- Consistent field names between code and database
- All required data in the database
- Proper type handling for mixed data formats
- Working progress tracking

The system is now fully consistent and operational.
